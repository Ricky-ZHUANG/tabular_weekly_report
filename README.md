- I was trying to salve the bug "can't launch tensorboard" when launching jupyter notebook [SOLVED]
- I was trying to launch jupyter notebook and open in my pc. It is running without error on server, but the link can't be opened in my pc. [still debugging]
```
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root --port 7790 --notebook-dir notebooks/ &
```
```
 To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-626-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://hostname:8888/?token=XXX
     or http://127.0.0.1:7791/?token=XXX
