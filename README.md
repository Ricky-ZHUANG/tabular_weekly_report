# Update: 2024/04/10 US Time
- I was trying to solve the bug "can't launch tensorboard" when launching jupyter notebook [SOLVED, I change the version of image to 19.09 pytorch]
- I was trying to launch jupyter notebook and open in my pc. It is running without error on server, but the link can't be opened in my pc. [still debugging]
```
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root --port 7790 --notebook-dir notebooks/ &
```
```
 To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-626-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://hostname:8888/?token=XXX
     or http://127.0.0.1:7791/?token=XXX
```
I tried the following method to forward this to my pc via running the following in my pc.
```
ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:rzhuang@129.106.31.45:7791 rzhuang@129.106.31.39
```
it returns
```

["Here are five different paraphrased versions of the patient's information:\nVersion 1\nThe patient is a White individual treated with paclitaxel, with a tumor located on the left side.

The tumor is estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, with no positive axillary nodes and a size of 2.0 cm.\nVersion 2\nThis patient, who is White, received paclitaxel treatment for a tumor on the left side, graded as intermediate. A core needle biopsy was performed for diagnosis. The tumor measures 2.0 cm and is positive for both estrogen and progesterone receptors, with no affected axillary nodes.\nVersion 3\nA White patient was treated with paclitaxel for a left-sided tumor, characterized as intermediate grade. Diagnosis was made via core needle biopsy. The tumor is 2.0 cm in size, positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, and has not spread to any axillary nodes.\nVersion 4\nThe patient, identified as White, underwent paclitaxel treatment for a left-sided tumor with an intermediate histologic grade.

- Used LLAMA3 to run the whole pipeline of meditab.
- I Tried several prompt methods, (e.g. giving few examples or use "please generate answer using XXXX" etc.) but all of them are not working.
- Tried ChatGPT with no system prompt. It obtained the same output. I guess the different outputs might be due to the difference between different models.
- Obtain a free openAI key. It claims that it everyday it provides 100 requests for us.
